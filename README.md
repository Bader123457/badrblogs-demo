## Author

Created by **Badreldin Elsayed**, First Year Computer Science Student at the University of Manchester. I personally created this project because it seemed as a brilliant idea to me, and I gained a lot of experience and learnt new things from building it. 

## Skills Gained 
- Basic Frontend Development (Was learning frontend skills while building, still a beginner in frontend though) 
- API Integration 
- Cloud & Serverless Backends
- AI Integration and Engineering 
- Security
- Software Engineering Workflows (Version control with Git & GitHub, Branching, merges, conflict resolution,Writing clean commit messages)

## Problems Faced
Two main problems were faced building this project:  
- At the beginning of working on this project I was facing very huge issues with pushing my commits, I had to use AI for that. 
- Faced a lot of difficulty implementing OpenAI API into my module, was able to overcome this problem but took a lot of time and hard work.  

## Tech Stack

Built with modern web technologies:
- **Vite** for fast development and building
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **React 18** with modern hooks and patterns
- **Tailwind CSS** for responsive styling
- **Supabase** for backend Edge Functions
- **OpenAI** for AI-powered content generation
